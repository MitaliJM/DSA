## String matching

Basically finding of a occurance pattern within a text where text and pattern are strings of characters with text >= pattern

### Applications

    * Content Searching
    * Editing
    * Text Processing
    * Signal Processing
    * Virus Scanning
    * Bioinformatics(DNA Strings)

### Algorithms

    * Naive String Matching (Brute-Force Algorithm)
    * Knuth-Morris-Pratt(KMP) Algorithm
    * Rabin Karp Algorithm
    * Boyer Moore Algorithm
